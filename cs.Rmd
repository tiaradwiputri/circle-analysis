# Lifestyle Changes in Last Decade

## Me 10 years ago...

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/status.png")
```

Facebook is my main source of social digital activities, even so with little to no information regarding my personal details  

People post status, write on each other walls, giving thumbs up and poking people    

## Me today...

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/dash.jpg")
```

## Social Media Takeover

- Your reflexes is to open instagram or at least other social media  
- You have at least 1 active social media to keep you updated with your friends and family  
- You express your mood, hobbies, interest, and association online  

Most of my time spent on Stardew Valley so I'm kinda safe...
